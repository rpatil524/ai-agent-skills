# ACP Client Skill

Execute checkout, cart, and order operations against the OpenLink Adaptive
Commerce Platform (ACP) API using composable `curl` recipes. Triggered by
natural-language purchase intents.

## When to Use

- "I want to purchase `{product}`" / "Buy `{product}`" / "Get me a license for `{product}`"
- "Checkout `{product}`" / "Create a checkout for `{offer-id}`"
- "Update checkout `{id}`" / "Change quantity for checkout `{id}`"
- "Cancel checkout `{id}`" / "Cancel my order"
- "Complete checkout `{id}`" / "Pay for checkout `{id}`"
- "Add `{product}` to cart" / "Create a cart for `{product}`"
- "Get order `{order-id}`" / "Check status of order `{order-id}`"
- "Get a Stripe test token" / "Generate SPT for `{amount}`"
- "Use balance" / "Pay with balance"
- Any request referencing the ACP API, checkout sessions, carts, or OpenLink
  software license purchases.

## Prerequisites

- `curl` installed
- `jq` recommended (fallback `awk` JSON parsers provided)
- `ACP_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable set, or user must obtain one manually
- `STRIPE_API_KEY` required for `complete` and `spt` flows

## ACP Instances

Known ACP API endpoints. The default is `shop.openlinksw.com`; override via `ACP_BASE_URL`:

| Instance | URL |
|---|---|
| **Shop (default)** | `https://shop.openlinksw.com/acp` |
| QA / Staging | `https://ods-qa.openlinksw.com/acp` |

To use a non-default instance, set `ACP_BASE_URL` before invoking the skill:
```bash
export ACP_BASE_URL="https://ods-qa.openlinksw.com/acp"
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `ACP_BASE_URL` | No | `https://shop.openlinksw.com/acp` |
| `ACP_API_VERSION` | No | `2026-01-30` |
| `ACP_AUTH_TOKEN` | **Yes** | Prompted if missing |
| `ACP_ITEM_ID` | No | Resolved from product catalog or user input |
| `STRIPE_API_KEY` | Yes (for complete/spt) | Prompted if missing |
| `STRIPE_PAYMENT_METHOD` | No | `pm_card_visa` |
| `STRIPE_SPT_CURRENCY` | No | `usd` |
| `STRIPE_SPT_MAX_AMOUNT` | No | `1000` |
| `STRIPE_SPT_EXPIRES_AT` | No | `now + 1 hour` (auto-computed) |

## Intent-to-Flow Mapping

When the user expresses a natural-language intent, map it to the corresponding
ACP flow:

| User Intent | Skill Flow |
|---|---|
| "I want to purchase `{product}`" | **Full purchase**: `create_checkout` → `get_checkout_total` → (`balance` or `spt`) → `complete_checkout` |
| "Checkout `{product}`" | `create_checkout` → return checkout session ID and total |
| "Update checkout `{id}`" | `update_checkout` — change items/quantity |
| "Cancel checkout `{id}`" | `cancel_checkout` — cancel with `reason_code: buyer_cancelled` |
| "Complete checkout `{id}`" | `complete_checkout` — fetch total, get SPT, complete |
| "Add `{product}` to cart" | `create_cart` → return cart ID |
| "Get order `{order-id}`" | `get_order` |
| "Get Stripe SPT" | `get_test_spt` |
| "Use balance" / "Pay with balance" | `complete_checkout` with `handler_id: "balance"` |

## Product Resolution

When the user names a product (e.g., "JDBC to ODBC bridge driver"), resolve it
to an offer IRI using the catalog in `references/product-catalog.md`. Match
against:

- `schema:name`
- `skos:prefLabel`
- `skos:altLabel`
- `schema:description`

If no match is found, ask the user for the full offer IRI or product URL.

## Bearer Token Acquisition (Manual)

If `ACP_AUTH_TOKEN` is missing or invalid:

1. **Prompt the user**: "ACP bearer token not found. Please obtain one from the
   OAuth applications page."
2. **Provide URLs**:
   - Primary: `https://ods-qa.openlinksw.com/oauth/applications.vsp`
   - Alternative: `https://shop.openlinksw.com/oauth/applications.vsp`
   - Additional: any other Virtuoso instance the user specifies
3. **Instructions**:
   - Navigate to the URL
   - Log in via the authentication form (Digest, WebID-TLS, or social login)
   - Register a new OAuth application
   - Copy the generated bearer token
   - Export as `ACP_AUTH_TOKEN` or paste when prompted

## Browser Automation

The skill uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) (`playwright-cli`) for
browser automation. PinchTab is a fallback if Playwright is unavailable.

Set the wrapper script path before use:
```bash
export PWCLI="/Users/kidehen/Documents/Management/Development/ai-agent-skills/.opencode/skills/playwright/scripts/playwright_cli.sh"
```

### Prerequisites

- `npx` (comes with Node.js/npm)
- Playwright browsers installed (first use): `npx playwright install chromium`

### Workflow

1. Open page in headed mode: `"$PWCLI" open <url> --headed`
2. Snapshot for element refs: `"$PWCLI" snapshot`
3. Interact with elements by ref (e.g., `"$PWCLI" click e79`)
4. Capture screenshots or PDFs as needed

## Subscription Payment Detection

After `complete_checkout`, the response may contain a `links` array with a
`subscription_payment` entry. When present:

1. Extract the `href` value from the link with `rel: "subscription_payment"`
2. Open the link with Playwright:
   ```bash
   "$PWCLI" open <href> --headed
   "$PWCLI" snapshot
   ```
3. Present the snapshot to the user showing the payment form.
4. Ask the user if they want to proceed with payment.

## Checkout Body Format

The `create_checkout` and `update_checkout` operations use `items` (not
`line_items`) and `capabilities` as an empty object:

```json
{
  "items": [
    { "id": "http://data.openlinksw.com/oplweb/offer/Offer-2020-10-virtuoso-8-app-developer-development-WKS-ANY#this", "quantity": 1 }
  ],
  "currency": "usd",
  "capabilities": {}
}
```

## Output Format

- **Default**: Human-readable summary (checkout ID, order ID, status, total,
  receipt, subscription payment link if present)
- **`--json` flag**: Raw JSON from the API response, stable machine-readable
  output for agent consumption

## Post-Purchase File Access Verification

After a checkout is completed and the subscription payment is processed, verify
that the purchased file/resource is accessible:

1. **Resolve the resource URL** from the offer IRI — typically the offer's
   `schema:subjectOf` or the resource's canonical DAV/WebDAV path on the
   ACP instance.

2. **Fetch with On-Behalf-Of delegation** using the ACP bearer token:
   ```bash
   curl -sI -H "Authorization: Bearer ${ACP_AUTH_TOKEN}" \
     -H "On-Behalf-Of: {resource-iri}" \
     "{resource-url}"
   ```
   > **IMPORTANT**: The `On-Behalf-Of` header value must be a **bare WebID URI — no angle brackets**. Correct: `-H "On-Behalf-Of: https://example.com/path#fragment"`. Angle brackets cause delegation resolution failure (402/401). The `{resource-iri}` placeholder uses curly braces conventionally — the actual value is a bare IRI.

   - `200 OK` → access granted, file is available
   - `401 Unauthorized` → provisioning may be async; retry after a short delay
   - `403 Forbidden` → access not granted; check order/subscription status
   - `404 Not Found` → wrong resource URL; verify path

3. **Report result** to the user: confirmed accessible, or explain the issue.

## Error Handling

- `401 Unauthorized` → Bearer token missing or invalid; direct user to OAuth
  applications page
- `404 Not Found` → Checkout/cart/order ID does not exist
- `409 Conflict` → Idempotency key collision; retry with new UUID
- Stripe errors → Report Stripe error message and raw response
- Missing `jq` → Fall back to bundled `awk` JSON parsers (`_json_str`,
  `_json_total`, `_json_sub_payment_url`)

## JSON Helper Functions

The skill bundles three portable JSON extraction functions that work with or
without `jq`:

- `_json_str FIELD` — extract a top-level string field from stdin JSON
- `_json_total` — extract `amount` where `type=="total"` from the `totals` array
- `_json_sub_payment_url` — extract `subscription_payment` href from `links[]`

See `references/acp-api-operations.md` for implementation details.

## Anti-Drift Protocol

⛔ **PRE-BUILD CHECK**: Before producing any curl command or output, re-read the
relevant operation section in `references/acp-api-operations.md`. Confirm headers,
body shape, and placeholder substitution. Build to pass — do not retro-fit.
